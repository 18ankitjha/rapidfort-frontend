Welcome to the File Detective web app! This application allows you to get detailed information about a specific file by providing its details. The app interacts with a REST API to retrieve the information and presents it using the EJS templating engine.

## Usage

1. Visit the hosted app at: [https://filedetective.onrender.com/](https://filedetective.onrender.com/)
2. On the homepage, you'll see an input form where you can enter details about the file you want to investigate.
3. Fill in the required information and click the "Submit" button.

## How It Works

The File Detective app collects the information you provide, such as the file name or path. It then communicates with the deployed REST API to fetch the relevant details about the file.

The REST API processes the input and returns a JSON response containing information like file size, creation date, and more.

## API Integration

The web app integrates with the File Detective REST API, which is hosted separately. The API handles the logic of gathering information about the provided file details.
